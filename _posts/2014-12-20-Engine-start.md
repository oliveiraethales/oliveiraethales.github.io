Firing the engine with this first post! :D

I'll start by writing a little bit about my thoughts regarding some general topics on our very amusing software world.
Well, I'm big fan of simplicity, elegancy and initiative. With that in mind, I faced some challenges in these almost 7 years of experience.
Most of these challenges were due to bad conceptions of what a software really is. And these bad conceptions usually come from a single point of origin: fear.

My mind opened regarding this subject when I've read 'Rework' a couple of years ago (and 'Remote' soon after it was made available). It really helped me to understand which are
the greatest obstacles to achieve success in a software company, and how to tackle these obstacles correctly.

Well, after being astonished of how simple and yet deep was the problem, I've started trying to improve myself first, so there would be no excuses from people around me to also improve
and hunt down the problems one by one. It was when I saw that even when people have the proper tools, they always try to complicate things and justify their mistakes.
And that's because of the fear of change. Change hurts, mainly the ego. So to rework our actions we first need to rework our thoughts.
